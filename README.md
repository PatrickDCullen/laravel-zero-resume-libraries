## Documentation

Note that to both build and run the built application, PHP 8.2 seems to be necessary. Building while using PHP 8.4 fails during the build process, and building using PHP 8.3 succeeds but then running the application throws an error. This might be a Herd error (when running the command referenced here: https://laravel-zero.com/docs/build-a-standalone-application#debug-information), both 8.3 and 8.2 show the message " - Module "herd" is already loaded in Unknown on line 0". See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-79150/Herd-module-error-when-Pest-testing-runs-via-PhpStorm-UI for possible solutions.
